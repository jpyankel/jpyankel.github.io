# Project Overview
Teapot Wars is a multiplayer, tile-based, dungeon crawler. Players race against
each other to find the Legendary Bag of Tea +3, a powerful item that grants
infinite power to the wielder (i.e. the player who finds it wins).

The game most prominent features:
* Networked multiplayer
* Random dungeon generation
* AI and pathfinding system
* 3D graphics and camera controls
* Music, UI, animations, and other polishing details

My project repository can be found on GitHub:
<https://github.com/jpyankel/Teapot-Wars-2>

The project repository has instructions on how to build and play the game.
Additionally, code is well commented and should be a decent learning resource.
