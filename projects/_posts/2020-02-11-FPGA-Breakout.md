# Project Overview
FPGA-Breakout is a lab project for Carnegie Mellon University's 18-240
Structure and Design of Digital Systems. There is a minimum spec for students
to complete, but **bonus points** are offered for implementing additional cool
features.

In a quest to obtain the maximum number of bonus points, I stayed in lab all
weekend to add:
* Multiplayer
* Multi-layered GUI rendering system.
* ASCII text renderer
* Title screen with mode selection.

Due to the nature of this being a class project, I cannot release any source
code or discuss implementation of the base project.

I can, however, conclude:

**bonus points achieved**
