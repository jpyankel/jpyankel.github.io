    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
My first interest in technology began in my childhood: The perfect mix of Star
Wars, Nintendo, and electronics snap-kits as influences instilled in me a
desire to learn how to create my own futuristic robots and cool video games.
    </p>
    <p>
I began my foray into the world of software development through programming my
own video games at 10 years old. Eventually, my teenage self decided being a
video game developer was my dream job, and I spent time learning programming,
3D modeling, and music composition. Check out my

to see some uploads of my early work.
    </p>
    <p>
When I started my journey as a student at Carnegie Mellon University, I soon
learned the amazing breadth the ECE field has to offer. My classes and
experiences at CMU converted me to a learner of all things ECE.
    </p>
    <p>
My current interests lie in embedded systems and electronics. My goal is to
eventually create devices to help people, whether the field be one in
biomedical, neurotechnology, or entertainment industries.
